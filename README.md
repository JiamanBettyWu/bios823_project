# BIOSTATS Final Project
Using the MIMIC III data to explore the factors influencing the outcome in ICU. This project can provide insights into identifying the riskiest patient and prioritize the ICU administration. More specifically, we would like to predict how long a patient will stay in the ICU with emergency admission. We are also interested in identifying the factors that may impact the time period a person will stay in ICU. Furthermore, we want to use explainable machine learning to explain and analyze the model results. 

## Background information
“In recent years there has been a concerted move towards the adoption of digital health record systems in hospitals. In the US, for example, the number of non-federal acute care hospitals with basic digital systems increased from 9.4 to 75.5% over the 7 year period between 2008 and 2014 (ref. 1).

Despite this advance, interoperability of digital systems remains an open issue, leading to challenges in data integration. As a result, the potential that hospital data offers in terms of understanding and improving care is yet to be fully realized. In parallel, the scientific research community is increasingly coming under criticism for the lack of reproducibility of studies2.

## Data Set
Here we reported the release of the MIMIC-III database, an update to the widely-used MIMIC-II database (Data Citation 1, demo data available at https://physionet.org/content/mimiciii-demo/1.4/). MIMIC-III integrates deidentified, comprehensive clinical data of patients admitted to the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, Massachusetts, and makes it widely accessible to researchers internationally under a data use agreement (Fig. 1). The open nature of the data allows clinical studies to be reproduced and improved in ways that would not otherwise be possible.”
